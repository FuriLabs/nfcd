Command line tools

These tools require nfcd to be running and functional. They
don't do much by themselves, the real work is delegated to
nfcd via D-Bus.

All tools have -h (--help) option.

A tool for communicating with ISO-DEP (Type 4) tags. Can send
arbitrary APDUs to the card and receive responses.

Type 2 or Type 4 tag.

either format a URI, Text or SmartPoster record by itself, or
read a pre-formatted one from the file.
